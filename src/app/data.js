    story: `
    Problem: Needed real-time video calls across devices; deployment on Vercel caused React Router issues.
    Solution: Implemented WebRTC video calls with Firebase signaling, tested with Cloudflare tunnels; fixed routing by adding custom vercel.json rewrites.
    Lesson Learned: Learned multi-device testing, production debugging, and identified UX gaps like missing unread message notifications for future iterations.

    description: "Real-time chat application with authentication and chat rooms.",
    story: `
    Problem: First-time backend experience; socket connections were unstable; CORS issues and route conflicts occurred.
    Solution: Built backend with Express.js, Socket.io, MySQL, JWT, and bcrypt; refactored socket logic into custom hooks and Context API; added error boundaries and user feedback components.
    Lesson Learned: Gained practical full-stack experience, learned best practices for socket handling, API design, and code organization for maintainable apps.

    story: `
    Problem: Collaborative drawing appeared in all rooms; chat UI consumed too much canvas space; Lighthouse performance score was low (50).
    Solution: Fixed socket join/leave events per room; moved chat to a modal with unread message badges; optimized code to increase Lighthouse performance to 65.
    Lesson Learned: Learned room-based socket management, UI/UX optimization for real-time apps, and performance tuning techniques.

    Problem: Inventory items multiplied incorrectly due to improper state management in useEffect.
    Solution: Refactored state logic to fix duplication; implemented responsive navigation with React Router for multi-path gameplay.
    Lesson Learned: Learned careful state management in React.

    Problem: Needed full-stack wellness platform with auth, user roles, and personalized plans.
    Solution: Built frontend in React + Recoil, backend with Express & Prisma, email confirmation with Nodemailer + Redis, admin dashboard, and responsive UI with Tailwind/MUI.
