# The COPY . . command will copy everything (including your node_modules and .next directories) into /src/app. You might not want this because it could conflict with volumes in docker-compose.yml. You'd want to avoid copying node_modules and .next into the container from the host.ADD a .dockerignore file to exclude these directories.
